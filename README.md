Like example use alternatives like form, table, and img, what's interesting was that HTML5 WG came up with header, footer, nav, and section to describe divs and other elements. The semantic tags are to enhace accessibility, searchability, internationalization, and interoperability. Semantic elements for document outling are to use header, nav, aside, section, article, and footer as well, each of the sections like body, section, article, aside and nav could also have their own header and footer. Theres inline semantic tags like mark and progress also the important tags are canvas, video and tags that should be stopped using.
